# Evolution
A small project about evolution model.
I try to develop some new life styles through it, but I have faced with paradox about "life": if you want to imitate lives, will you imitate their structures or behaviors?
I won't continue until I figure out it.

It can imitate the evolution of a population of grass which is plant in a 100*100-matrix.
However, it just foucus on the height of grass by now.
I plan to make it more convinient to obsever the change of the population and add more information to it such as animals and changes of enviroment.
